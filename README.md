## What is **SAML** and **SAML 2.0**?
**[SAML](https://www.oasis-open.org/standards#samlv2.0)** is a specification for a SSO (Signle Sign-On) method/process using XML, Certificates and Digital Signatures.

Here I will talk specifically about **[SAML 2.0](https://www.oasis-open.org/standards#samlv2.0)**


This also you to create a standard well known configuration file or endpoints on how to connect to your IDP (Identity Provider) or SP (Server Provider).
This standard configuration file is normally know as 'Metadata' some other services have sightly differing names for it e.g. **ADFS** (Active Direcoty Federation Services)
calls in 'FederationMetadata' for reasons I will not get into here (see **[ADFS](./ADFS.md)** for more).


## What SAML is not
It is not OAuth


## But...Wait how does it actually work?


## Hmm...So I sort of get it, but this will only work inside the clients network right?
